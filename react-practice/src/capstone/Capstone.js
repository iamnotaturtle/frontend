 * üèÜ
 * The goal of this capstone project is to bring together most of the
 * concepts you have learned in this tutorial together by building this feature.
 * The feature we are building is pretty straight forward. There's an input
 * field and a search button. When the user types in a valid stock ticker and
 * clicks Search button, it will display the company profile as well as
 * company financial for the given stock ticker selected.

         * üí° Some things to note below inside the return:
         * 1. We are passing `handleSearch` function to `Search` component as `onSearch` props.
         *    `Search` component will execute this props when the user clicks Search button.
         *     and it will pass the current value on the input field as an argument to this function.
         *     Remeber above we we updated the state when this function is called
         * 2. We are passing `stockTicker` props to both `CompanyProfile` and
         *    `CompanyFinancial` components. These components should use the `stockTicker`
         *    props to fetch the appropriate data from the API provided and render it.
         * 3. We have a line like {EmptyTickerMessage}. It's the constant we defined above.
         *    We assigned a JSX to a constant and rendered it here inside curly braces.
         *    This is a cool thing about JSX. They can be passed around like any object or function or data.
